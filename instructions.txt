$ west update 
$ west packages pip --install  -> updates the packages

$ west build    -> call to create folder

The venv is inside the my_app library
$ source .venv/bin/activate

To build the source with the sample go to /zephyr

$ west build -b nrf5340dk/nrf5340/cpuapp samples/basic/blinky

As for the device field, that should be the device identifier for J-Link - which from what I can see does appear to be either nRF5340_xxAA_APP or nRF5340_xxAA_NET as appropriate.
